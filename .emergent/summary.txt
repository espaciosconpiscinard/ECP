The AI engineer's work largely focused on extending and stabilizing the Espacios Con Piscina application, moving from core feature enhancements to critical deployment and data integrity fixes. Initial tasks involved fixing admin password hash issues and implementing dynamic filtering for commissions and expenses. A significant portion of the trajectory was dedicated to troubleshooting deployment and API validation errors, particularly  validation failures due to missing fields in older database entries and CORS misconfigurations. The engineer introduced data migration scripts and manual database update instructions to resolve these. Subsequent efforts concentrated on refining Excel import/export logic for categories and services, addressing issues like missing  fields, Excel formula character limits, and incorrect price field mappings. The final segment of the trajectory began implementing a comprehensive set of new features, including a client editor, enhanced flexible pricing defaults, and advanced reservation/expense logic, facing an update error while implementing the client editor due to a backend issue.

<product_requirements>
The Espacios Con Piscina application manages villas, reservations, clients, and expenses with role-based access. Initially, it required robust reservation/client management, payment tracking, customizable invoices, and an expense tracker. Evolving requirements led to professional invoice redesigns, partial payments, and advanced expense management (user-creatable categories, payment reminders, grouping, filtering). Other features included cascade deletion, customer management, admin user management, dynamic logo handling, bulk operations, manual invoice numbering, and hierarchical Excel import/export. Recent additions include user approval, flexible pricing tiers (Pasadía, Amanecida, Evento with configurable people/prices), an automatic commission system (editable, filtered by user, payment tracking, bi-weekly filtering), and a full backup/restore system. Latest requests include a customer editor, dynamic expense updates based on villa price changes, extra people/hours fields in villa forms/Excel, dynamic expense generation for manual reservation prices, in-form client creation for reservations, multiple suppliers for additional services, advanced expense tracking (extras, ITBIS), a supplier expense summary, and a dynamic logo upload for invoices/home.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on a large set of new features, prioritized by the user. Specifically, the high-priority task being addressed was the implementation of a default flexible price selection for villas.

The following changes were in progress and partially completed:
1.  **Client Editor**: The frontend component  has been updated to include functionality for editing client information. This involved adding a  API call to  and modifying the  logic, ,  function, and UI elements (edit button, dialog title, submit button) in the  component.
2.  **Backend Client Update Endpoint**: A  endpoint was added to  to support the client editor. An initial bug related to  was fixed by simplifying the update logic.
3.  **Flexible Price Default**: The  model in  was updated to include . The  component was being updated to add a Por Defecto checkbox next to each flexible price entry. This has been implemented for Pasadia and Amanecida prices, and the AI was in the process of implementing it for Evento prices when the trajectory ended.

The user had reported a persistent Failed to fetch error when trying to update a client, which was diagnosed as a backend issue and subsequently fixed by refining the  endpoint in . The last instruction from the user was to continua con todas, si hay errores lo vemos despues, indicating a preference for broad implementation before detailed testing.
