The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles a complex, iterative development process, primarily focused on enhancing the Espacios Con Piscina application's reservation, expense, and commission management. Initial tasks involved UI refinements and bug fixes, such as renaming the Propietarios tab and addressing login issues. A major effort was dedicated to overhauling the expense abono modal in  and the reservation form in  to correctly display and manage payments for owner, extra services (with suppliers), and security deposits. This involved numerous backend model () and frontend (, ) code adjustments for data consistency and proper rendering.

Key challenges included persistent date serialization issues across frontend and backend, incorrect environment variable usage ( vs. ), and a  error for reservation updates due to a missing backend PATCH endpoint. The engineer also implemented multi-selection and bulk actions for commissions. A significant recent focus has been on refactoring the reservation creation form into two variants (Villa vs. Solo Servicios) to address errors with service-only bookings and simplify the UI. This specific task is currently ongoing, marked by a recent syntax error in conditional rendering.

<product_requirements>
The Espacios Con Piscina application manages villas, reservations, clients, and expenses. The core problem is to provide a comprehensive system for rental and service businesses. This includes robust reservation and client management, payment tracking, customizable invoices, and an expense tracker.

**Implemented Features & Refinements:**
*   Professional invoice redesigns with partial payments.
*   Advanced expense management: user-creatable categories, reminders, grouping, filtering,  checkbox.
*   Cascade deletion.
*   Customer/admin management.
*   Dynamic logo handling and upload for invoices/home.
*   Bulk operations.
*   Manual invoice numbering.
*   Hierarchical Excel import/export for various data types.
*   User approval for access.
*   Flexible pricing tiers: Pasadía, Amanecida, Evento (with  checkbox).
*   Automatic commission system.
*   Full backup/restore system.
*   Customer editor for quick client creation.
*   Extra people/hours fields in villa forms/Excel, with automatic loading for reservations.
*   Dynamic expense generation for manual reservation prices.
*   Multiple suppliers for additional services, with associated  and .
*   Advanced expense tracking, including  category and a supplier expense summary.
*   Renaming Propietarios tab to Propietarios y Servicios in Expenses.
*   Making the application logo a clickable home button.
*   Adding villa location to invoices.
*   Redesigned expense abono modal to show detailed reservation info (extras, people, hours) and allow payments to owners and suppliers.
*   Reservation/invoice list shows only an indicator for extra services.
*   Security deposit managed in expense abono modal, impacts invoice pending status.
*   Commission module with multi-selection for bulk delete/mark as paid/unpaid.
*   Reservation form with two variants: Villa or Solo Servicios (for DJ, buffet etc.).

**Outstanding Requests (from trajectory):**
*   **Internal Note for Invoices**: An internal note visible only to the system, separate from the client-facing note.
*   **Quotations and Delivery Notes**:
    *   Quotations: Similar to invoices, but with a different design/policies and an own editor.
    *   Delivery Notes: Similar to quotations/invoices but without prices (for employees/suppliers/clients without seeing costs).
*   **PDF Download Button**: In Facturas (Reservations section), next to print, a PDF download button.
*   **Commission Control for Deleted Invoices**: If an invoice is deleted, its commission should be marked as such, allowing approval/disapproval.

    -   **Changes**:  and  now include .  uses  instead of /.
-   ****: Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes**: Logic for auto-creating supplier expenses was commented out then reactivated and modified to allow filtering. Date handling () for reservation and expense creation was corrected to prevent day shifts.  endpoint now updates  of related expenses.
-   ****: Used to store . Critical fix from  to  was applied here, impacting all API calls.

    -   **Changes**:  now uses a PUT request to align with backend's full update mechanism, replacing a non-existent PATCH.
-   ****: Manages expenses.
    -   **Changes**: Renamed Propietarios tab to Propietarios y Servicios. Modified  to fetch  data. The abono modal was completely redesigned to display distinct input fields for Propietario, Servicios Extras (with supplier details), and Depósito de Seguridad (with a checkbox for returned). The  function was updated to exclude  expenses from the main list. Logic to load and display  within the owner's expense detail modal was added. Owner payment input now defaults to . Fixed  typo to .

    -   **Changes**: Renamed Reservaciones to Facturas and Nueva Reservación to Nueva Factura. Villa * label changed to Villas Y Servicios and made optional. Extra service selection was modified to *not* auto-select a supplier initially.  was updated to ensure correct price calculation (using ) and recalculates  totals. Invoice list now shows a generic badge for Servicios Extras instead of details. The abono modal for invoices was reverted to its simple form, removing detailed reservation info (as it's intended for the *expense* abono modal). Critical date handling fixed in  to prevent date shifts by removing . Implemented  state and conditional rendering to support two form variants: 'villa' and 'service'. The 'service' variant hides irrelevant fields like rental type, extra people, base price, guests. Ensured  is correctly populated for extra services.

-   ****: Reused for in-form client creation.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to prevent unintended  calls upon customer creation, which previously caused form closures and empty invoice creation in .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical issues and implementing a major feature: the Solo Servicios invoice variant.

The user reported the Quick Client () bug persisted, where creating a client still closed windows and automatically created an empty invoice. The Single Service Invoice Error (an Objects are not valid as a React child error, which later manifested as a  due to  being required by the backend) also persisted. User explicitly requested prioritizing the implementation of two invoice variants (one for villas, one for services only), believing it would resolve the single service invoice error.

The AI engineer implemented the  state and introduced conditional rendering in  to switch between 'villa' and 'service' forms. The 'service' form was designed to hide irrelevant fields like Tipo de Renta, Precio Base, Pago Propietario, Huéspedes, and extra hours/people. The Evento button was changed to Servicios for the service-only type. The  function was updated to ensure  is correctly populated.

The immediate last message from the user (Chat Message 519) indicates a  in  related to a JSX comment . This error suggests a mismatch in closing conditional rendering tags. The AI identified that the closing  for  was missing, causing the subsequent JSX to be parsed incorrectly. The last action (Chat Message 522-524) was to fix this syntax error.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the syntax fix for the  conditional rendering and ensure the Solo Servicios form is now rendering and functioning correctly without syntax errors.
