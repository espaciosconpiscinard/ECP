<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully initiated and developed a full-stack villa management application based on incremental user requirements. Starting with basic system setup and authentication, the engineer then implemented core modules for reservations, villa owners (later renamed to villas), and expenses. A significant part of the trajectory involved refining the reservations and villa management forms, incorporating features like different rental types, payment methods, extra services, and automatic calculations for remaining balances and ITBIS. The engineer demonstrated adaptability by iteratively adjusting the UI and backend models based on detailed user feedback, including correcting misinterpretations of field placements (e.g., villa pricing in reservation vs. villa management forms). Database schema adjustments and API endpoint modifications were consistently made to support new features, and the application was regularly restarted and tested for functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's feedback that the Precio al cliente and Pago a propietario fields should be in the Villas management section, not the Reservations form.

The engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Creating **: A new React component () was created to handle the management of villas, including their , , ,  (now optional), , , and .
2.  **Updating **: The main  routing was modified to use  instead of the previous  component for the corresponding route.
3.  **Removing Price Fields from **: The explicit input fields for  and  were removed from the  form, as these values should now be automatically pulled from the selected villa.
4.  **Backend Update for Villa Schedule**: The  model in  was updated to include  and  fields.
5.  **Frontend Update for Villa Schedule**: The  component was updated to include input fields for  (default entry/exit times). The  in  was also updated to load these  fields.
6.  **Restarting Services**: Both the backend and frontend services were restarted after these code changes.
7.  **Recreating Villas**: Existing villa data was deleted, and new sample villas were created via API calls, including the , , and  information.

The very last user feedback was about the HORARIOS POR DEFECTO section in the  form, indicating it was showing, but also an image implied some confusion. The engineer clarified that the fields were implemented and asked the user to hard refresh their browser cache. The user then responded with ESTO NO DEBE IR AHI, referring to the Precio de la Villa section *still being visible* in the **reservation form**, despite previous attempts to remove it or move its context.

The most recent action was:  after using  to remove the price section from  (Message 356). The immediate next step (Message 357) was to restart the frontend.

<optional_next_step>
Restart the frontend and confirm the Precio de la Villa section is removed from the reservation form.

<direct_quotes_for_next_step>
¡Entiendo! Esa sección de Precio de la Villa NO debe estar visible en el formulario de reservaciones. Los precios deben cargarse automáticamente de la villa seleccionada pero sin mostrar esa caja. Voy a quitarla:
Perfecto! Ahora voy a reiniciar el frontend:
