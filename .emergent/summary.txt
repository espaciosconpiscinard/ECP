The AI engineer's work in this trajectory focused on resolving critical bugs and implementing a significant feature: the Solo Servicios invoice variant. Initial work verified a previous syntax error fix in  for conditional rendering, which proved successful for displaying two invoice types (Villa and Solo Servicios) within a single form. A persistent Quick Client bug, creating ghost invoices, was partially addressed by changing a  callback from  to .

Subsequent user feedback revealed continued issues: the Solo Servicios invoice triggered a , and the Quick Client bug persisted. The  error was traced to an  for  in , caused by duplicate  statements and mandatory // fields in . These backend issues were fixed by removing duplicate imports and making the fields optional. The UI was then refactored to implement separate Nueva Factura and Factura Solo Servicios buttons, simplifying user flow. This UI change itself caused multiple JSX syntax errors in  due to incorrect  closures, which required iterative debugging, including a call to , before finally rendering correctly. The trajectory ends with the user confirming Solo Servicios invoices are being created but reporting the Quick Client bug and expense display issue persist.

**Outstanding Requests (from trajectory):**
*   **Internal Note for Invoices**: An internal note visible only to the system, separate from the client-facing note.
*   **Quotations and Delivery Notes**:
    *   Quotations: Similar to invoices, but with a different design/policies and an own editor.
    *   Delivery Notes: Similar to quotations/invoices but without prices (for employees/suppliers/clients without seeing costs).
*   **PDF Download Button**: In Facturas (Reservations section), next to print, a PDF download button.
*   **Commission Control for Deleted Invoices**: If an invoice is deleted, its commission should be marked as such, allowing approval/disapproval.
*   **Bug: Quick Client Ghost Invoice**: Creating a new client via Cliente Rápido still creates an empty/ghost invoice.
*   **Bug: Solo Servicios Expense Display**: Expense for Solo Servicios is created but not shown in the main expenses list, only in the summary.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing two critical issues reported by the user after implementing separate buttons for Villa and Solo Servicios invoices.

The user reported that the Factura fantasma (ghost invoice) bug still persists when creating a new client via the Cliente Rápido functionality. This implies that the previous fix of changing  to  in  was insufficient or incorrect.

Additionally, the user confirmed that Solo Servicios invoices are now successfully being created (indicating the backend  fixes and  changes were successful in resolving the ). However, they noted a new problem: the expenses associated with these Solo Servicios invoices are generated correctly in the backend but are not visible in the main expenses list; they only appear in the summary.

The AI engineer acknowledged these two problems and, at the very end of the trajectory, stated the intent to first investigate the  component again to debug the ghost invoice issue.
