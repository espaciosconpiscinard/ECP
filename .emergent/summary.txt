The AI engineer's work in this trajectory was a continuous cycle of feature implementation, bug fixing, and refinement based on user feedback. It started with completing the is_default checkbox for flexible prices in . A critical bug regarding default prices not displaying in the villa list led to the creation of a  helper. The agent then added extra hours/people fields to Villa and Reservation models and forms, and implemented automatic loading of these values. Backend logic was updated to always create owner expenses for reservations. The client editor was integrated into the reservation form for quick client creation. A significant effort was dedicated to implementing multiple suppliers for extra services, necessitating extensive model and UI changes. Detailed expense tracking, including supplier expenses and a summary, was also added. UI improvements like making the logo a home button and adding villa location to invoices were also completed.

Numerous bugs were encountered and resolved, including Pydantic  for  objects, a  due to missing expense categories, and various frontend syntax errors related to misplaced braces and function scoping in  and . The latest user feedback highlighted issues with expense visibility (badges for extras not showing for all invoices) and the absence of supplier payment options within the expense detail modal. The AI acknowledged these and was about to implement renaming the Propietarios tab to Propietarios y Servicios.

<product_requirements>
The Espacios Con Piscina application manages villas, reservations, clients, and expenses. Initial requirements included robust reservation/client management, payment tracking, customizable invoices, and an expense tracker. The application evolved to feature professional invoice redesigns, partial payments, advanced expense management (user-creatable categories, reminders, grouping, filtering), cascade deletion, customer/admin management, dynamic logo handling, bulk operations, manual invoice numbering, and hierarchical Excel import/export. Recent additions included user approval, flexible pricing tiers (Pasadía, Amanecida, Evento), an automatic commission system, and a full backup/restore system. Latest requests include a customer editor, dynamic expense updates, extra people/hours fields in villa forms/Excel, dynamic expense generation for manual reservation prices, in-form client creation for reservations, multiple suppliers for additional services, advanced expense tracking (extras, ITBIS), a supplier expense summary, and a dynamic logo upload for invoices/home. Crucially, the system needs to visually identify expenses with extra services/people/hours and facilitate payments to suppliers directly from expense details. Also, the reservation form should allow booking services independently, and the Propietarios expense tab should reflect services.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback concerning the display and payment functionality for expenses. The user reported that expense items in the list view (e.g., invoice #1604) did not clearly indicate if they included extra services, hours, or people, and crucially, clicking on an expense did not consistently display the detailed list of these services with their suppliers, nor provide an option to make payments (abonos) to those suppliers.

The AI had implemented several fixes: enhancing the backend to store  within the owner expense, updating  to show a service badge in the list, and creating a modal in  to display detailed expense information by fetching the associated reservation. During this process, a critical backend  (using  on Pydantic objects) and a  (missing  category) were identified and fixed.

However, the user's latest feedback (Chat Message 515, 518) indicated that the visual indicators for extras were still inconsistent across invoices (only new ones worked as expected), and the core issue of being unable to make payments to suppliers from the expense modal persisted. The user also explicitly requested two new UI changes: renaming the Propietarios tab in the Expenses section to Propietarios y Servicios and changing the Nueva Reservacion button to Nueva Factura in the Reservations section, while also enabling the selection of services independently.

The AI acknowledged these points, specifically vamos hacerlo mas en orde, and was preparing to implement the first of these new UI changes, starting with renaming the Propietarios tab.
