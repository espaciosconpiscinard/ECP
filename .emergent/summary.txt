The AI engineer successfully enhanced the Espacios Con Piscina application, progressing from initial bug fixes and core feature additions to addressing complex user requirements. Key accomplishments include fixing an expense display bug, implementing dynamic sorting and filtering for expenses, and adding bulk deletion capabilities across various entities. Significant work was done on invoice management, introducing unique invoice numbers for individual payments (abonos), and displaying these prominently. A comprehensive hierarchical Excel import/export system was developed, with frontend UI and backend endpoints established for importing data like customers and villas. Recent efforts heavily focused on debugging deployment issues, resolving admin login failures caused by  misconfigurations, database name discrepancies, and  mismatches in MongoDB Atlas. The current immediate task is to rectify the  for the admin user in the deployed MongoDB Atlas instance.

<product_requirements>
The Espacios Con Piscina application manages villas, reservations, clients, and expenses with role-based access. Initially, it required robust reservation/client management, payment tracking, and customizable invoices (multi-currency, extra services). Villa management needed , , , , and an expense tracker. Evolving requirements led to professional invoice redesigns, separate villa/service management, partial payments (abonos), and advanced expense management (user-creatable categories, payment reminders, grouping, month-based filtering, overdue display, advanced sorting). Other features comprised cascade deletion, customer management with search/alphabetical listing, admin-controlled user management, dynamic logo handling, multi-selection for bulk operations, form persistence post-save, manual invoice numbering for admins, and a hierarchical data import/export system via Excel with auto-generated expenses. The application transitioned to a web-based solution.

        -   Endpoints  and  were updated to accept and process optional  for abonos.
        -   New GET endpoints for hierarchical template downloads (, , ) and POST endpoints for hierarchical file imports (, , , etc.) were added. These import endpoints were repositioned in the file to be registered correctly by FastAPI. CORS configuration was also corrected. Debug logging was removed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: *Newly created* module to handle the generation of structured Excel templates for various data entities (e.g., Customers, Villa Categories, Villas) as part of the hierarchical import system.
    -   **Changes**: This file contains the logic for creating and formatting these Excel templates.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: *Newly created* module to handle the processing of uploaded hierarchical Excel files.
    -   **Changes**: Functions were implemented to parse Excel data, create/update database entries, and ensure mandatory fields like  (set to ) and correct villa field mappings are applied during the import process.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Lists Python dependencies for the frontend.
    -   **Changes**:  was moved from  to  to fix desktop application build errors.

    -   **Importance**: Manages client reservations, payment records (abonos), and invoice printing.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   The abono creation form was updated with an  input field.
        -   The reservation list view was modified to display the main  along with a list of  for associated abonos.
        -   New summary cards (Total Reservations, Pending, Paid, Remaining) and their calculation logic were integrated into the reservation dashboard.
        -   The  function was significantly refactored to asynchronously fetch all abonos and dynamically include the initial payment and all subsequent abono details (date, amount, invoice number) in the generated printable invoice, including new CSS styles. Multiple syntax errors in complex template literals were debugged and resolved.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages business expenses and their associated payments (abonos).
    -   **Changes**: The abono creation form was updated with an  input field, and the abono history list was modified to display the  for each abono.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was primarily focused on assisting the user with the deployment of the application to a production environment (MongoDB Atlas, Render.com, Vercel) and resolving critical post-deployment issues.

**Current state of work:**
1.  **Hierarchical Import/Export System**: The backend now includes  and  with corresponding GET endpoints for template downloads and POST endpoints for importing data (Customers, Villa Categories, Villas). The frontend  displays a hierarchical UI with steps, record counters, download, and import buttons.
2.  **Deployment Guidance**: Detailed , , and  files were created, and the user was guided through setting up MongoDB Atlas, Render, and Vercel.
3.  **Admin Login Debugging**: A major issue was the user's inability to log in to the deployed application. This involved:
    *   Correcting the  in  (and ensuring it's correctly picked up by Render).
    *   Guiding the user through setting the correct  and  in Render's environment variables.
    *   Identifying a potential mismatch in the  for the  user, which was manually inserted into MongoDB Atlas.
    The AI engineer confirmed the backend logic for login is sound and that / credentials should work if the database entry is correct.
4.  **Import Data Display Issues**:
    *   Initial client imports failed due to a missing  field, which was subsequently fixed in .
    *   Imported villas were not displaying due to mismatches between the import template's simplified fields and the  model's expected fields, and the absence of associated  entries in the database. These schema and category dependency issues were addressed.

The current immediate task is to rectify the  of the admin user in the *deployed* MongoDB Atlas instance to enable successful login for the user.
