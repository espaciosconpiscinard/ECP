The AI engineer successfully enhanced the Espacios Con Piscina application, progressing from initial bug fixes and core feature additions to addressing complex user requirements. Key accomplishments include fixing an expense display bug, implementing dynamic sorting and filtering for expenses, and adding bulk deletion capabilities across various entities. Significant work was done on invoice management, introducing unique invoice numbers for individual payments (abonos), and displaying these prominently. A comprehensive hierarchical Excel import/export system was developed, with frontend UI and backend endpoints established for importing data like customers and villas. Recent efforts heavily focused on debugging deployment issues, resolving admin login failures caused by  misconfigurations, database name discrepancies, and  mismatches in MongoDB Atlas. The current immediate task is to rectify the  for the admin user in the deployed MongoDB Atlas instance.

<product_requirements>
The Espacios Con Piscina application manages villas, reservations, clients, and expenses with role-based access. Initially, it required robust reservation/client management, payment tracking, and customizable invoices (multi-currency, extra services). Villa management needed , , , , and an expense tracker. Evolving requirements led to professional invoice redesigns, separate villa/service management, partial payments (abonos), and advanced expense management (user-creatable categories, payment reminders, grouping, month-based filtering, overdue display, advanced sorting). Other features comprised cascade deletion, customer management with search/alphabetical listing, admin-controlled user management, dynamic logo handling, multi-selection for bulk operations, form persistence post-save, manual invoice numbering for admins, and a hierarchical data import/export system via Excel with auto-generated expenses. The application transitioned to a web-based solution. Recent additions include an admin approval system for new users, flexible pricing tiers for villas based on rent type (with customizable Personas and Cliente/Propietario fields), an automatic commission system for reservations (editable amount, filtered by user, with payment tracking and bi-weekly filtering), and a full backup/restore system.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing and refining the commissions management system based on extensive user feedback.

**Current state of work:**
1.  **Commissions System Enhancements**: The  frontend component has been significantly refined. It now displays commissions created automatically upon reservation, linked to the user who made the reservation.
2.  **User-centric View**: The commissions dashboard includes cards displaying accumulated total, paid, and pending commissions for each employee (full names are displayed). A dropdown filter allows admins to view commissions for specific users.
3.  **Payment Tracking**: Individual commissions can be marked as paid using a dedicated button (replacing a previous checkbox) to prevent accidental changes.
4.  **Date-based Filtering**: A crucial enhancement is the ability to filter commissions by month and bi-weekly periods (quincenas), using the *reservation date* (not the creation date) as the basis, as per user's specific business logic.
5.  **Visibility of Reservation Date**: The table now includes a Fecha Reserva column to clearly indicate the date used for filtering.
6.  **Personas Extras field**: The  component has been updated to include input fields for Personas Extras and Costo Personas Extras to allow for additional charges beyond the flexible pricing tiers.

The very last explicit request was to include the Fecha Reserva in the commissions table. This was implemented in the last tool call.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Add the Fecha Reserva column to the commissions table in the frontend to display the reservation date for each commission entry.
