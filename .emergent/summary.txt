The AI engineer's work primarily focused on iteratively fixing critical bugs and implementing new features. Initially, efforts were directed at the Solo Servicios invoice variant and a Quick Client ghost invoice bug. The Solo Servicios  was resolved by making , , and  optional in  and fixing duplicate  imports in . The display issue for Solo Servicios expenses was addressed by introducing a  category in  and updating  to display them.

The Quick Client ghost invoice bug proved more elusive, requiring multiple rounds of debugging. Initial fixes involved adjusting a  callback, but the core issue was later identified as unintended form submission from a  button within a nested dialog in . This was fixed by explicitly setting . Subsequently, user feedback clarified the ghost invoice occurred specifically when creating a client from the Nueva Factura context. The ultimate fix involved adding  in 's , reordering callbacks, and adding a delay.

Feature additions included an internal notes field for invoices, basic models and API endpoints for Quotations and Conduces, UI components and navigation for them, and a mechanism to mark commissions for deleted invoices. The PDF download functionality was a major challenge, undergoing several iterations (html2pdf, jsPDF, simplification) before the user requested its removal due to persistent issues and costs. The task then shifted to creating print-only Conduce functionality (without prices) directly from Facturas and Quotations, and enabling quotation-to-invoice conversion. The trajectory concludes with the AI working on integrating the Conduce print functionality into Quotations after simplifying it from a standalone module to a print option within Facturas due to compilation errors and user preference.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a compilation error reported by the user and a new set of simplified requirements for Conduce functionality.

The user expressed frustration with the persistent PDF download issues and explicitly requested its removal. Instead, they asked for a Conduce button on the Facturas (Reservations) page that would print the *same invoice but without prices*. This indicates a significant simplification: Conduce is no longer a separate module but a printing variant of an invoice.

The AI engineer acknowledged these changes and was in the process of implementing them:
1.  **Removed Conduces Module**: The dedicated  route, menu link, and the  and  components were deleted.
2.  **Updated **:
    *   Removed  related imports and functions ().
    *   Removed states related to the .
    *   Replaced the previous  (which would open a dialog) with a new  function. This new function is responsible for printing the reservation details, but with prices hidden, effectively creating a delivery note (conduce).
    *   The Generar Conduce button in the Reservations detail view was updated to call this new  function.
    *   The entire  component was removed from .

The very last action in the trajectory was the AI stating it would hacer lo mismo para Quotations - agregar botón Conduce que imprime sin precios, indicating the same print-without-prices functionality needs to be added to the Quotations component.
