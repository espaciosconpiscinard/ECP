<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully initiated and developed a full-stack villa management application based on incremental user requirements. Starting with basic system setup and authentication, the engineer then implemented core modules for reservations, villa owners (later renamed to villas), and expenses. A significant part of the trajectory involved refining the reservations and villa management forms, incorporating features like different rental types, payment methods, extra services, and automatic calculations for remaining balances and ITBIS. The engineer demonstrated adaptability by iteratively adjusting the UI and backend models based on detailed user feedback, including correcting misinterpretations of field placements (e.g., villa pricing in reservation vs. villa management forms). Database schema adjustments and API endpoint modifications were consistently made to support new features, and the application was regularly restarted and tested for functionality.

<product_requirements>
The user's core need is a comprehensive villa management application, Espacios Con Piscina. Initial requirements included user management (admin/employee roles), reservation/client management with payment tracking (total, paid, deposit, remaining), editable invoices, and multi-currency support. Villa management needed , , , , and optional ITBIS. An expense tracking section, a dashboard for statistics, and application branding were also requested.

Over time, requirements expanded:
*   **Invoice Customization:** Professional design, company details, flexible pricing, custom extra services, payment method selection, and starting invoice numbers.
*   **Villas & Services**: Renaming Villas section to Villas y Servicios to include other services catalog. Villas to be displayed in a list view, clickable for details, with sales users restricted to client-side pricing. Category management for villas with search functionality.
*   **Abonos (Payments):** Implement partial payment system for reservations and expenses, including tracking  and allowing negative  for returns.
*   **Expense Management Enhancements:** Auto-register owner payments as expenses upon reservation creation. Introduce a separate system for expense categories (user-creatable, e.g., Luz, Nómina). Implement payment reminders (day of month, recurring) with visual indicators and grouping. Improved search for expenses by invoice, villa, client, or owner.
*   **Deletion Logic:** Cascade deletion of associated expenses and abonos when a reservation is deleted. Allow deletion of manual expenses, but protect auto-generated ones.
*   **Customer Management**: A dedicated section for managing customers (CRUD operations) separately from reservations, including optional DNI/passport fields, and a search feature in the reservation form to select existing customers.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two persistent issues reported by the user:
1.  **Deletion of Manual Expenses:** The user reported that the delete button for manual expenses was still not visible or functional in the  section. This indicates that despite previous attempts, the  component, which was restored to an older version due to persistent JSX errors, still does not correctly allow deletion of manual expenses or display the button correctly.
2.  **Optional DNI/Passport for Customers:** The user requested to add an optional  or  field when adding a new client. This is a new data field for customer records.

The AI engineer's most recent stated action (Chat Message 538) was: ## 1. Primero agregar cédula/pasaporte al modelo Customer en backend. This indicates the immediate focus is on updating the  data model in the backend to accommodate the new optional identification fields before proceeding with frontend adjustments or addressing the expense deletion bug.
