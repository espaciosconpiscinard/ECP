The AI engineer successfully progressed the Espacios Con Piscina application from initial feature set to a robust management tool, adapting to dynamic user requirements. The trajectory highlights the shift from local MongoDB to cloud-based MongoDB Atlas, addressing numerous technical challenges including SSL connection issues, Python library compatibility, and Node.js memory limits. Key features implemented include comprehensive user management with role-based dashboard visibility, a customizable invoice system with editable templates and starting counter, and a refined expense tracker featuring custom categories, recurring payments, and ordering logic. Initially, efforts were made to create a desktop  application using Electron, but this was ultimately deprioritized due to persistent local environment issues (Git, network, permissions, icon errors) and user's pivot to a web-based solution for easier updates. The current focus is on fixing a bug in the expense display logic and preparing for web deployment.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a comprehensive Espacios Con Piscina villa management application with user roles (admin/employee), robust reservation/client management including detailed payment tracking (total, paid, deposit, remaining), and customizable, editable invoices supporting multi-currency, flexible pricing, extra services, payment methods, and starting invoice numbers. Villa management needs , , , , and optional ITBIS. An expense tracker and a statistical dashboard were also specified.

Evolving needs led to:
1.  **Professional Invoice Redesign**: Logo, , full villa description, specific colors. This was further expanded to an in-app **Invoice Editor** for custom fields, policies, and design.
2.  **Villas y Servicios Revamp**: Selector for Villas/Services, separate forms and listings.
3.  **Abonos (Partial Payments)**: For reservations and expenses (implemented in existing ).
4.  **Enhanced Expense Management**: User-creatable categories (CRUD), payment reminders (day of month, recurring), grouping, improved search. New requirement added: **ordering by reservation date**, **prioritizing upcoming/overdue expenses**, **separating Fixed/Variable/Unique expenses**, and **Unique expenses without payment dates**.
5.  **Cascade Deletion for Reservations** and **Deletion of Auto-Generated Expenses** (already implemented).
6.  **Customer Management**: Optional , search feature in reservations. New requirement added: **Customer searcher and alphabetical listing**.
7.  **User Management**: Ability for admin to create user accounts and roles.
8.  **Application Deployment**: Initially, a desktop  installer (for Windows 10/11, accessible locally/remotely, no constant server), later shifted to a **web-based solution** due to build complexities.
9.  **Dynamic Logo Management**: User requested to remove hardcoded logo and implement an in-app uploader in Configuración for application header and invoices.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend Expense Management (Bug Fix):** Correct the filtering logic in  where tabs use plural types ('variables', 'fijos', 'unicos') but the backend model/data uses singular ('variable', 'fijo', 'unico'), causing expense details not to display correctly.
-   **Deployment Guidance (Web Version):** Provide detailed documentation and steps on how to deploy the application as a web application for team usage (shifted from desktop .exe).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing several new features requested by the user. These included:
1.  **Dynamic Logo Management**: A backend model (), API endpoints, and a frontend  component (integrated into ) were created. The  header and  invoice generation were updated to fetch and use this dynamic logo.
2.  **Customer Enhancements**: The backend API () was modified to return customers sorted alphabetically. The frontend  component was updated to include a search input field and display the sorted list.
3.  **Advanced Expense Management**: The  model in  was extended with an  field (fijo, variable, unico). The  frontend component underwent a significant refactoring to incorporate this new type. It now includes state for  and , filtering and sorting logic based on  (prioritizing upcoming and overdue expenses), an  field in the form, and interactive tabs (Fixed, Variable, Unique) to view expenses.

After implementing these features and restarting services, the user reported a critical bug: newly added expenses (fixed, variable, with reminders) were not appearing in the detailed list below the summary, only the sum was shown, and the intended sorting by date was not working. Upon reviewing the user's feedback and screenshot, the AI engineer identified the immediate problem as a mismatch between the plural names used for the expense type tabs in the frontend (, , ) and the singular values expected by the backend model (, , ). This mismatch is preventing the correct display and filtering of expenses.
